	abstract = {A Monte Carlo method is used to evaluate the Euclidean version of Feynman's sum over particle histories. Following Feynman's treatment, individual paths are defined on a discrete (imaginary) time lattice with periodic boundary conditions. On each lattice site, a continuous position variable xi specifies the spacial location of the particle. Using a modified Metropolis algorithm, the low-lying energy eigenvalues, {\textbar}Ïˆ0(x){\textbar}2, the propagator, and the effective potential for the anharmonic oscillator are computed, in good agreement with theory. For a deep double-well potential, instantons were found in our computer simulations appearing as multi-kink configurations on the lattice.},
